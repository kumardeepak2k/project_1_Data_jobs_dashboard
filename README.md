# Data Job Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes job openings in the data field (Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, etc.) across various job listing platforms such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. The aim is to identify hiring trends, skill requirements, salary insights, and geographical demand for data-related roles worldwide.

## Problem Statement
With the increasing demand for data professionals across industries, job seekers often struggle to identify the most valuable skills, competitive salaries, and job availability in different regions. Employers, on the other hand, need insights into hiring trends to refine their recruitment strategies. This project aims to bridge this gap by analyzing job postings to extract meaningful insights that benefit job seekers and employers.

## Dataset

- **Job Title**: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, etc.
- **Company Name**: The organization posting the job.
- **Location**: Country and city of the job opening.
- **Employment Type**: Full-time, part-time, contract, etc.
- **Experience Level**: Entry-level, mid-level, senior-level.
